        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>Provide a centralized website that can be accessed by anyone at the company and contains useful and organized information about various projects that people at the company are working on. Users should be able to add projects, view projects, search project, make new projects from a template, create templates, export templates, export projects, export all projects, among other things.</p>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>My team collaborated remotely and in person. We used Jira to keep us on task, and manage our progress throughout our sprints. We met three times a week at minimum and sometimes more to troubleshoot specific issues. At every meeting we gave updates on our progress, talked about our troubles, and focused on what we would do for next time. We communicated on Discord and via text message when urgent.</p>

        <h2>Tools and Frameworks Used</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Flask API</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>MongoDB</li>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>User Experience</h2>
        <p>A general use case for adding a new project would be something like this:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>User visits the website via a link or bookmark</li>
          <li>User logs into the website</li>
          <li>User can now see all projects and templates</li>
          <li>User can search or query for certain parameters. When the user sees that the project is not available, they decide to add it</li>
          <li>User adds the project. They add various information about the project, and can optionally build off of a pre existing template.</li>
          <li>User can then optionally decide to export the project</li>
          <li>User saves the new project, now it is added to the website and is visible to others.</li>
        </ol>
